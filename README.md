# Pandas-HW

I chose to do the Academy of Py and below you will find my three observable trends.



The Academy of Py allowed me to notice three observable trends and they are:

1.) The top four performing schools, based on overall passing rate, had student sizes all under two thousand.

2.) Conversely, the bottom seven performing schools had student sizes over two thousand.

3.) Lastly, a higher budget per student does not necessarily mean there will be higher passing rates


I not able to complete the last exercise where we create bins based on the type of school (charter or district). Dzimitry was helping me try to correct an area I was struggling or made a mistake in I am running out of time to submit on time. I will keep playing around with the code and try to correct it. I would love to see a key and/or get some feedback on the assignment, especially where I didn't complete the assignment.

I believe it has to do with the 'type' column being deleted from an earlier DataFrame and running into a problem trying to get that column inserted into a later DataFrame for this operation.
